Migrate to official Claude Code llms.txt format and redesign output for better UX. The tool now automatically fetches the latest documentation list from https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt, eliminating manual maintenance. List command output has been completely redesigned for both AI mode (48% token reduction) and human mode (40% better screen density) with descriptions now inline instead of separated. All 47 documents are properly categorized with new tree-style hierarchy for table of contents.
